                <p>Get Bridgend Online is a project where different organisations work together aiming to get the whole of Bridgend digitally included. The partner organisations involved are <b>Communities 2.0, TimecentresUK, Valleys2Coast, The Local Service Board</b> and <b>Bridgend Council</b>. This project fits in the <em>Digital Inclusion Framework</em>, as set up by the Welsh government in 2010.</p>

                <p>Digital technologies are ever-increasing and changing fast. The internet is a part of everyday life and is used for many different reasons, whether it be economical (e.g. searching for work, online shopping), socially (e.g. using Skype) or for public services. That means digital skills have now become as essential as reading and writing. However, it is estimated that about 34% of the Welsh adult population does not know how to use the internet or do not have access to it. People who are not able to use the internet, miss out on many things, making them socially and economically disadvantaged. That is why the Digital Framework Wales was set up by the Government in 2010. <strong>Get Bridgend Online is extremely proud to be part of this!</strong></p>

                <p>The team consists of six paid staff and a large number of Digital Champions , working in different venues across Bridgend borough. We all love technology and we love helping people, and our job is a combination of the two. So come and meet us at one of those venues or contact us via this website or social media.</p>

                <p>Everyday, we are out and about teaching people how to get online and how to make the most of the internet. We cater for all abilities and ages. Our sessions are always free, informal and can be taught on a one-to-one basis or in a group. You can even bring your own equipment (tablets, computers, phones etc.) or you are more than welcome use ours.</p>

                <p>An important part of our work is helping people use the Government Gateway website, which gives access to Universal Credits (applying for benefits, searching for work etc.)</p>

                <p>We are also happy to be involved in helping people in sheltered housing schemes, libraries and community centres. Anyone can come to these sessions and ask us their questions related to digital skills. In short; we are not telling you what to do, you tell us what you want to learn and we take it from there.</p>

                <p>Topics we regularly cover are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basic computer skills</li>
                    <li>Online shopping</li>
                    <li>Facebook</li>
                    <li>Skype</li>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <li>Photoshop</li>
                    <li>Computer security</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A new element of the Get Bridgend Online initiative is the training of front-line staff. We give the framework on how to teach digital skills to people they work with on an everyday basis. This includes Jobcentre staff and sheltered housing scheme staff. This enables us to reach even more people. Please contact us for further information.</p>

                <p>We could not do this without our Digital Champions. They give some of their time every week to help others get online. They come from all walks of life, and besides a good knowledge of all the basic digital skills, they each have their own area of expertise.</p>

                <p>Becoming a Digital Champion couldn&#39;t be easier. Training is normally no more than 2 days and will give you all the &lsquo;knowhow&rsquo; needed to start helping people get online in your community.</p>
